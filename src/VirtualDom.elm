{-| A performance optimization that delays the building of virtual DOM nodes.
Calling `(view model)` will definitely build some virtual DOM, perhaps a lot of
it. Calling `(lazy view model)` delays the call until later. During diffing, we
can check to see if `model` is referentially equal to the previous value used,
and if so, we just stop. No need to build up the tree structure and diff it,
we know if the input to `view` is the same, the output must be the same!

{-| Create a custom event listener.
    import Json.Decode as Json
    onClick : Signal.Address a -> Property
    onClick address =
        on "click" Json.value (\_ -> Signal.message address ())
You first specify the name of the event in the same format as with
JavaScriptâ€™s `addEventListener`. Next you give a JSON decoder, which lets
you pull information out of the event object. If that decoder is successful,
the resulting value is given to a function that creates a `Signal.Message`.
So in our example, we will send `()` to the given `address`.

{-| Options for an event listener. If `stopPropagation` is true, it means the
event stops traveling through the DOM so it will not trigger any other event
listeners. If `preventDefault` is true, any built-in browser behavior related
to the event is prevented. For example, this is used with touch events when you
want to treat them as gestures of your own, not as scrolls.
